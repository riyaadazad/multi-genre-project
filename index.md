Welcome! I decided to present my project for Honors English 10 in an entirely different medium&mdash;the world wide web! This site will always live [here]({{ site.baseurl }}).

I have chosen to organize this project as a weblog. To learn more about the project guidelines, please go to this site's ['About' page](about/).

In addition to blog posts, this project consists of three main parts. The [first part]() of posts focuses on planning. The [second part]() is centered on my responses to different genres, and the [third part]() consists of material created by me to illustrate my comprehension.
