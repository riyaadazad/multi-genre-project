## Creating a Multi-Genre Project

### What is a Multi-Genre Project?
A multi-genre project requires you to read/view multiple types of text, guided by a theme or a topic. Then, you will represent your learning by creating multiple genres of your own.

### This Project is a Three-Part Process:
1. Decide on a topic you would like to explore. Read and view a variety of genres on the topic.
2. Respond to the texts you choose, explaining how and why they illustrate your theme or answer your questions.
3. Create &amp; publish a variety of texts that illustrate your understanding of the topic.

### How Do I Find Texts to Read/View?
First, you need to decide on the topic you want to explore. Then, start researching. Ask your teacher or librarian to help you; spend time checking the internet. Look for articles, news stories, poems, songs, videos, etc., that can help you better understand the concept or theme you have chosen. When you search, use a narrow focus, rather than a broad one.

### What Do I Do When I Read/View?
First, read/view and enjoy. Then, you need to read or view the text again, looking for ways that it develops the theme you are investigating, or that it answers any questions you have. Use the organizers in this workbook to record quotes from your reading as well as your own thoughts and ideas. There is also an organizer that allows you to do the same with visuals or multi-media texts.

### What About the Writing Component?
The purpose of this project is for you to explore and make conclusions about a topic. Once you do, then you need to represent your learning through your own creations. Think about what you have learned, do some journaling or doodling, talk about it with others and then make your own conclusions. Then, use the organizers provided to brainstorm ideas for your creations.

> This is a chance for you to explore a topic that interests you. Be sure to choose something that does.

### For This Project You Will:
* Explore ideas/themes/questions through reading and viewing multiple genres.
* Reflect on the ideas presented in the texts studied in class.
* Do your own research, looking for ideas not presented in class.
* Analyze and evaluate the ideas.
* Come to your own conclusions about the topic.
* Create a project that presents your conclusions about the topic using multi-genre writing.

### Part One: Reading and Viewing
The first part of your project will require you to explore your theme/idea/questions through reading and research. You must read a minimum of FOUR texts other than the ones studied in class AND you must choose at least one text from each of the categories listed below (note: these are just partial lists).

#### Fiction

### Part Two: Responding to Text
The second part of your project will require you to present your conclusions about your topic. You must refer to a minimum of FOUR texts other than the ones studied in class AND you must have at least one text from each of the categories listed above. You will:

#### Respond to Each of the Texts Chosen:
1. How does the source relate to your topic?
2. How did reading or viewing the source help you understand your topic better?
3. How did the creator of the text get these ideas across to the reader or viewer? (Here you will comment on how the creator of the piece may have used, for example, literary, visual, or dramatic techniques to get his/her point across.)

### Part Three: Writing &amp; Representing
1. You will create a "Dear Reader" letter that illustrates your learning throughout this process. You will begin with a short explanation as to why you  chose the topic and then explain what you learned from the reading and viewing you did, as well as how your own creations illustrate your understanding of the topic.
2. This part of the project will require you to present your conclusions about your topic through your own writing and representing. You must include a minimum of FOUR of the following texts, with one from each category (Note: this is a partial list):

#### Fiction
* Poetry
* A diary entry
* A scene from a play
* A scene from a story
* A letter from a character
* A comic strip

#### Non-Fiction
* Speech
* News article
* An editorial
* An essay
* A blog entry
* Top ten lists

#### Multi-Media
* A video
* A song that you record
* A podcast
* A recorded interview
* A recorded newscast

#### Visuals
* Photographs
* Advertisements
* Paintings
* Photo Essays
* Sculptures
* Cartoons

> When deciding on a genre, be sure to think about how and why that particular form is a good one to present your ideas. In other words, do not just choose it because you like the genre, choose it because it is the best choice for you.

### Presenting the Project
There are a variety of ways you can present your learning:
1. A blog like *blogger*, *wordpress*, etc.
2. A PowerPoint presentation
3. A Prezi
4. A paper copy
5. Other&mdash;if you have another creative idea that's wonderful, but check with me first.

> Please get your presentation format approved by me first!

Regardless of your format, remember that this project should not just be a random collection of ideas. You need to be sure that the viewer/reader will clearly see the connection to the topic and between each element of your project.
