# How the Advertisement *Watson at Work: Engineering* Relates to My Topic

This print advertisement for Watson by International Business Machines Corporation relates to my topic that artificial intelligence can be human because it can work with other scientists to develop cures for diseases.
In this scenario, the artificial intelligence is replacing what would be a stereotypical human, which means that if it can replace a human, it probably can be considered human.
The advertisement asks viewers: “Can your doctor know everything known to medicine? IBM Watson is helping doctors design better treatments. Let’s Build a Smarter Planet.”

# How Viewing *Watson at Work: Engineering* Helped Me Understand My Topic Better

Viewing this advertisement enabled me to understand the above, that if artificial intelligence can display enough stereotypical human qualities that it is used like a stereotypical human, then that must mean that the artificial intelligence in question can definitely be human.

# How the Author of *Watson at Work: Engineering* Conveyed these Ideas to the Reader

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) conveyed these texts to the viewer by employing literary and visual techniques to get their ideas across.
IBM used a literary question to invoke the thoughts of viewers, by asking if a human can know everything.
Some humans have almost infinite knowledge, but this is very rare.
Watson, an artificial intelligence, on the other hand already has this knowledge, so it is like a human.
Although artificial intelligence has the capability to know everything, some humans can also do this, but knowledge is ever increasing, just like the universe keeps increasing.
