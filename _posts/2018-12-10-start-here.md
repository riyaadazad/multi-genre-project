Welcome!

I decided to present my project for Honors English 10 in an entirely different medium&mdash;the world wide web! This site is permalinked and will always live [here]({{ site.baseurl }}).

I have chosen to organize this project as a weblog. To learn more about the project guidelines, please go to this site's ['About' page](about/).

In addition to blog posts, this project consists of two main parts. The first part of posts focuses on my responses to different resources, and the second part consists of material created by me to illustrate my comprehension.

Quick jump to the first part of posts:
1. [Frankenstein](#)
2. [Poem](#)
3. [Trust in AI](#)
4. [I Am Watson](#)
5. [Watson at Work: Aviation](#)
6. [Watson at Work: Engineering](#)
7. [IBM Watson: Smarter Planet](#)

Quick jump to the second part of posts:
1. [Lorem](#)
2. [Ipsum](#)
3. [Dolor](#)
4. [Sit](#)
5. [Amet](#)

This site is built using the super simple static website and blog site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source code for this website is completely open and lives at [this GiHub repository](https://github.com/riyaadazad/multi-genre-project).

I hope that you enjoy this project as much as I have enjoyed designing and developing it.

Sincerely,

***Riyaad Azad***
