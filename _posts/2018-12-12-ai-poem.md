# How the Poem *Artificial Intelligence* Relates to My Topic

This poem on artificial intelligence, entitled “[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/artificial-intelligence-2/),” by Susan T. Aparejo, is a source that relates to my topic of artificial intelligence because, firstly, its title is artificial intelligence, and second of all, it touches upon actions performed by artificial intelligence that could be considered human.
The poem says:
> Though artificial but geniune [sic], <br>
Though not a human but has brain, <br>
Though no emotions but teach how to emote, <br>
Though not eating but teach how to cook, <br>
Though not writing but teach how to write, <br>
Though not studying yet it gives tips in studying, <br>
Though no diploma but a master in all degrees, <br>
The master of all, but sometimes meet trouble, <br>
Like humans, it feels tiresome, <br>
Just unplugged and open once more, <br>
your artificial gadget, <br>
Never complain even being called as <br>
'Computer'

# How Viewing *Artificial Intelligence* Helped Me Understand My Topic Better

Reading/viewing this poem helped me to understand my topic of artificial intelligence’s humanity, or human nature, better because it showed how even though the author conveys the idea that artificial intelligence is not human, it inadvertently shows how human artificial intelligence really is.
This is because the author of the poem says artificial intelligence has brains, knows about emotions, knows how to cook, knows how to write, knows how to study, is a master in all degrees, feels tired, and never complains.
This is effectively showing that artificial intelligence is human because it does things that humans also do.

# How the Author of *Artificial Intelligence* Conveyed these Ideas to the Reader

The creator/author of the text got her ideas across to the reader through mainly literary techniques to get her point across, by crafting her poem in such a way that it could be interpreted in different ways.
