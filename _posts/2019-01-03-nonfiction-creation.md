Google's Assistant. It may not have a catchy name, but it does have a catchy service. The artificially intelligent virtual assistant is still a popular service today. Users have the choice between Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa, and more. But Google's Google Assistant may be the key to expanding the reach of all virtual assistants.  

Since the Apple iPhone arrived on the scene, nearly a decade ago, technology enthusiasts have been creating new technologies, particularly in the field of virtual and artificial intelligence. Credit goes to Apple's Siri for opening the eye of the public to the use of virtual assistants, but now Siri is not the hottest thing in tech world anymore. Amazon's Alexa became popular in a somewhat-unfortunate way, by accidentally recording private conversations after mistakenly hearing an activation, or wake, word (in this case, "Alexa..."). But Alexa also grew in popularity because it was sponsored by Amazon, which millions of people use every day, so it was able to gain publicity fairly quickly in that aspect as well. Microsoft's Cortana was first made accessible to the millions of Windows 10 users, then gradually expanded to mobile Apple iOS and Android devices, among other devices. But not all Windows users utilize the feature, and some Windows users even left the platform altogether after Microsoft Windows released faulty updates, among other inconveniences that occur with Microsoft Windows software-as-a-service (SaaS) approach.

Ultimately, all of these platforms started with a lot of popularity, then gradually into the backdrop of technology as new tech rose up to fill their places. One of these technologies is the Google Assistant, which has the ability to reach millions through Google's popular search engine. Right now, if the Google Assistant doesn't change it's course, it could go down the same road as its predecessors. But if Google is able to integrate it's Google Assistant with  Google Search and other Google apps, it might just stand a chance to be the game changer in the wide world of virtual assistants and artificial intelligence.

# Author's Note
I used an editorial to explain my stance that Google Assistant can be a revolutionary virtual assistant/artificial intelligence.
