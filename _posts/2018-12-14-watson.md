# How the Video *I am Watson* Relates to My Topic

[This video advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1oKVc5EfF0) by the International Business Machines Corporation relates to my topic of artificial intelligence being human.
The video is designed as a montage of humans in different industrial fields saying statements such as an African-American girl saying “I am a technological breakthrough,” a female African-American scientists saying “This morning I read over 4,000 articles on leukemia in less than a second," and a man of an unknown ethnicity speaking in a different language: “I can be fluent in a new language in a matter of weeks.”

The advertisement even featured a young girl saying “I can understand euphemism … and complex metaphors,” and a Caucasian man saying “I know every detail of every public quarterly report in the last twenty years,” and the last speaker is another African-American girl saying “And I’m just getting warmed up.”

The video ends with a view of Watson on a tablet-like device, saying: “Hello, my name is Watson.
Together we can out think the limits of what’s  possible. Welcome to the cognitive era.”
This video shows that artificial intelligence is similar to and can be human because it shows artificial intelligence performing human capabilities, albeit on a much grander scale (but it is still however actions that humans could do).

# How Viewing *I am Watson* Helped Me Understand My Topic Better

Viewing this video helped me understand that artificial intelligence can be human, because even though Watson could do all of the things said in the advertisement, it being said by humans, which shows that artificial intelligence can do the same things as humans, and more (but by being able to do human actions, artificial intelligence can, without a doubt, be considered human).

# How the Author of *I am Watson* Conveyed these Ideas to the Reader

International Business Machines Corporation conveyed this message to the viewer through multiple visual and dramatic techniques, such as having humans say things that Watson can do to show that the artificially intelligent Watson can perform actions that were normally considered human, but double the performance and output compared to a human.
Nevertheless, as long as artificial intelligence can perform human actions, it can be considered human, regardless of its appearance.
