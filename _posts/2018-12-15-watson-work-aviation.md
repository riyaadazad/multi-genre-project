# How the Video *Watson at Work: Aviation* Relates to My Topic

[This video advertisement](https://www.ispot.tv/ad/wIpB/ibm-watson-watson-at-work-aviation) by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) relates to my topic because it shows how Watson, an artificially intelligent creation by the American company IBM, was able to perform stereotypical human tasks.

# How Viewing *Watson at Work: Aviation* Helped Me Understand My Topic Better

Viewing this video advertisement enabled me to understand that artificial intelligence can be human.
The video showed three male workers on a break, having a conversation about “the new guy, Watson.”
It showed how while the humans were on break, Watson was diligent and dedicated to his job (monitoring the status of aircraft), and this is what every employer seeks in a human employee.

# How the Author of *Watson at Work: Aviation* Conveyed these Ideas to the Reader

International Business Machines Corporation used visual and somewhat dramatic techniques to get its point across to the viewer.
It showed how while the stereotypical humans were on a break, artificial intelligence didn’t need breaks (except perhaps to charge) and could still perform human tasks.
The drama in this video was that Watson displayed such human behavior, that when one of the workers asked it a question, Watson told him that they were not “on speaking terms,” which is a very human thing to say.
