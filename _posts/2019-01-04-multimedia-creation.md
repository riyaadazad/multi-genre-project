# Author's Note
I created catchy music for a montage (video) promoting the positive aspect of artificial intelligence. It begins by asking the viewer if they believe that artificial intelligence (AI) can be human. Then it gives several reasons why AI can be human, and at the end it reasserts that AI can be human. The audio is by [Power Past Impossible](http://powerpastimpossible.org/)&mdash;I do NOT own the audio. I used Google Slides to create the content. Below is a brief explanation of each slide:

1. AI can wake people up like a loved one can wake someone up (perhaps by recording that loved one's voice).
2. AI can bring light by automatically switching on the lights when it gets dark, and turning off the lights when it gets brighter. A (human) person usually does this, but now AI can do this.
3. AI can make food through automatic ovens, toasters, microwaves, and stoves, much like how a human adult could cook.
4.  AI can clean dishes through automatic sinks and dishwashers, sort of like how humans wash dishes.
5. AI can lock doors automatically when someone leaves and can also let the person know the door is locked through a text message or phone call. This is like if a human person were to lock the door and text the person who is leaving that they locked the door.
6. AI can make music (and noise) like a human.
7. AI can drive (autopilot in planes, cars, and trucks) like stereotypical humans can.
8. AI can make calls and sound like a human while doing it (Google Duplex).
9. AI can be a detective/police officer/criminal investigator in a mystery/case, much like the human Sherlock Holmes.
10. AI can be a coworker or replace humans in daily job environments.
11. AI can be a doctor by analyzing and diagnosing people, much like a human doctor, and maybe even better.
12. AI can make more money through automated tasks, etc.
13. AI can match a person and help them to find their significant other.
14. AI can build and construct (robots) bridges and other infrastructure.
15. AI can explore the cosmos and actually help us find aliens.
16. AI can predict who will win games like the Super Bowl by analyzing data on every player, etc.  
17. AI can save lives by helping to alert authorities and giving information on how to save a life, among other things.
18. Because of all these reasons and more, AI can most definitely be human.
